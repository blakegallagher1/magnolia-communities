- ✅ **20+ other packages** updated for stability

### 2. Automated Monitoring Setup

✅ **GitHub Actions Security Audit Workflow**
- Runs monthly (1st of each month at 9 AM UTC)
- Triggers on dependency changes
- Manual trigger available
- Fails CI on critical/high vulnerabilities
- Email notifications enabled

✅ **GitHub Dependabot**
- Already active and monitoring
- Daily scans for new vulnerabilities
- Automatic PR creation for updates
- Email alerts for critical issues

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation

Created 3 security documentation files:

1. **SECURITY.md** - Current vulnerability status and policies
2. **SECURITY_MONITORING.md** - Detailed monitoring procedures
3. **SECURITY_SUMMARY.md** - This executive summary

## ⚠️ Remaining Vulnerability (Accepted Risk)

### ecdsa 0.19.1 (Low Severity)

**Issue**: GHSA-wj6h-64fc-37mp - Minerva timing attack on P-256 curve  
**Severity**: Low (side-channel attack)  
**Fix Available**: ❌ No (explicitly out of scope for python-ecdsa project)  
**Risk Level**: Very Low

**Why This Is Acceptable**:
1. Timing attacks are extremely difficult to exploit in production
2. Requires attacker to control both template content AND filename
3. Needs thousands of timing measurements
4. python-ecdsa project explicitly states this is out of scope
5. No production use of P-256 signing in critical contexts

**Mitigation**:
- Documented in SECURITY.md as accepted risk
- Monitored for alternative libraries
- Will reassess if usage pattern changes

```

### Backend Verification
```bash
cd backend && pip-audit -r requirements.txt
# Result: Found 1 known vulnerability in 1 package
# Name: ecdsa, Version: 0.19.1, Fix: None available ✅
```
